Autonomous Sailboat Protocol

:::: Controls :::::

Steer:

	S{absolute rudder position - values 100..1250}|{sail absolute position - value 100..900}|

Maintain:

	M{compass direction}|{point of sail}|
	C - current compass position

Stop - go into the wind:
	T

Stay - try to stay in the same position
	Y 

Do a 360
	3

Do a 720 
	7

Tack (go to same point of sail on other side): 
	T

Jibe (go to same point of sail on other side)
	J

Autonomous - goto waypoint:
	GHP - go home - to be defined later
	G{latitude}|{longitiude}|

Settings - need to edit this

	E P(proportional tuning value) I(integral tuning value) D(derivitive tuning value) T(highest tilt angle; 0 means disabled) 

Request Data - need to edit this

	R G(optional: GPS) P(rudder and sail position) S(status)




:::: Data :::: - this may change

Control status:
	S (any of these) T(teleop) M(maintaining) A(autonomous) M(Tacking or Jibing) || in addition E(taking measurements) P(taking pictures) 

Tilt angles:
	T S(sideways) F(front and back) A(Acceleration)

Wind: 
	W D(raw direction) I(corrected direction) S(speed) P(corrected Speed)

GPS:
	G A(Latitude) O(Longitiude) S(Speed over ground) C(Accuracy) D(Direction)
