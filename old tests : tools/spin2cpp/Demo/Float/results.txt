Here are some results of running time.spin either in the spin
interpreter or compiled in C++.

The expected series result is 0.9990234 (which all of the functions got).
It is the sum from 1 to 10 of 1/2^(1+n). The timing output is the time
to calculate this series:

Spin interpreter:
F32:          832.4 microseconds
Float32Full:  926.4 microseconds
FloatMath:  15435.6 microseconds

C++: (options -Os -mfcache)

F32:          696.6 microseconds (469.8 at -O2)
Float32Full:  498.2 microseconds (475.6 at -O2)
FloatMath:   2129.0 microseconds (2384.8 at -O2)
FloatNative:  558.6 microseconds (561.6 at -O2)

Note: to test with FloatNative, compile for FloatMath
and then manually edit time.h to include "FloatNative.hh"
and replace all references to FloatMath with FloatNative.
