Version 1.03

- Use for() loop instead of do/while for simple counting loops
- Added a -o option to specify the output file name
- Fixed error messages after #include (so correct line number and file
  information is preserved)
- Made the search paths for #include and OBJ sections relative to the
  currently processed file.
- Added --binary output option to produce a .binary file
- Fixed a bug in the DAT section output for classes with names that
  have "Spin" appended.
- Fixed DAT section output in C mode.
- Fixed several other miscellaneous bugs.

Version 1.02

- Made CON section accept x[y] syntax for skipping over ranges of values
- Modified C/C++ output so that unused return values are not declared
- Fixed reboot command to really reboot (not just abort)
- Fixed a typo which could cause segmentation faults
- Follow Spin's practice of allowing the first object of an object
  array to be used without a subscript.
- Accept annotations on the DAT section of a file.

Version 1.01

- Output symbolic names for constants instead of the constant value itself
- Added missing =>= and =<= operators
- Put the spin2cpp version number in the comment header of generated
  files

Version 1.00

- Fixed a problem with parsing negative floating point constants
- Fixed use of $ in PASM data declarations
- Some fixes to the internal source code

Version 0.99

- Added preliminary support for translating PASM to GAS (--gas)
- Added support for waitpne and waitpeq
- Fixed the trunc operator

Version 0.98

- Cleaned up and improved preprocessor
- Added #include, #elseifdef, #elseifndef

- support for placing C code inline in the Spin code (via "annotations")
- bug fix for reverse()
- sort variables the way Spin does

Version 0.95. New in this version:

- arrays of objects
- fix outa[pin] with variable pin
- handle TAB characters correctly
